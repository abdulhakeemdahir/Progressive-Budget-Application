## Description

Hello everyone, and welcome back to my Repo! My name is Abdulhakeem Dahir and I am an aspiring Software Developer. This week I have been tasked to make a Progressive Budget Tracker Application. This application will need to still work even when Offline, and when it comes back Online, it should automatically send the data to the DB. Hope you like, any feedback is welcome.
